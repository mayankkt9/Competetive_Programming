Greedy Approach
  - Try breaking problems into smaller problem
  - Try to think of sorting, that does help at many places in greedy 



Data Structure Improvement


You can add entryset to the priority queue and then sort it based on key or value.

Good Approach Question | Come to Revise Later
LC 406. Queue Reconstruction by Height
484. Find Permutation (Nice approach, I did came up with solution but with a long code)
1247. Minimum Swaps to Make Strings Equal (Came up with the logic nearly)
1055. Shortest Way to Form String (This question has a nice data structure to check if a character exist in part of substring in O(1))
