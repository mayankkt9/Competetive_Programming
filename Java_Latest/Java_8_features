Lambda Expression - Basically an anonymous function

public int square(int n){
	return n*n;
}
can be converted to 
n->n*n; 
(For only one line in method body curly braces are not required)
(return keyword not required)


Functional Interface (Only one abstract method and multiple default or static methods are possible)
Example Runnable -> run()
Example ActionListener -> actionPerformed()

interface Interf{
	public void m1();
}
class A implements Interf{
	public void m1(){
		Sysout("Hi")
	}
}

Instead of creating new class to implement body of m1, we can write lambda expression
As functional interface has only one abstract method so it know which implementation method it is.
main(){
	Interf i = ()->Sysout("Hi"); 
	i.m1();
}
